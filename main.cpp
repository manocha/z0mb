/*
milestone 6a
high scores saved between program executions.
you write names and high scores to a file when the program is exited.
the file is read upon starting up the program (if it exists),
and created fresh if it doesn't exist.

at least 3-levels.
the background color/image must be different between the levels
higher levels are to be harder â€“ not necessarily faster.

at least 2 items that have a player-aware AI
(i.e., they track the player, or avoid being hit)
